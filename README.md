# Guess-the-word-py-tk
A mini project where the user have to guess the letters of the word. Basically like hangman, but without the hangman. This is one of the mini project suggestion from  r/beginnerprojects

Improvement could be done as i seen some suggesstion in the reddit comments where hints could be given to help the user.

Additional words can be added in the words.csv file.
